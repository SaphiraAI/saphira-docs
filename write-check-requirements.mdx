## Write & Check Requirements Overview

Saphira's **Write & Check Requirements** feature provides a comprehensive workflow for refining requirements through classification, quality checking, traceability linking, and export. This workflow is used both for manually written requirements and for refining requirements extracted from documents.

## Getting Started

From the Home Page, navigate to the **Seek Guidance** section and click **Write & Check Requirements**, or use this workflow after extracting requirements from documents.

## Write & Check Workflow

The Write & Check Requirements workflow guides you through a structured process:

```
Input → Classify → INCOSE Lint → Trace → Conflicts → Export
```

<Steps>
  <Step title="Input">
    Enter your requirement text manually, or import from:
    - Extracted requirements from documents
    - CSV files with requirement tables
    - Jama Connect integration
    - Manual entry
  </Step>
  <Step title="Classify">
    AI automatically suggests requirement classification level:
    - Stakeholder
    - System
    - Subsystem
    - Component
    - Hardware/Software
    
    Review the suggested classification and rationale, and adjust if needed.
  </Step>
  <Step title="INCOSE Lint">
    Quality check against INCOSE requirements engineering principles:
    - **Atomicity**: Single capability per requirement
    - **Verifiability**: Testable with single procedure
    - **Clarity**: No ambiguous terms
    - Suggested rewrites for improvement
    
    Review lint results and apply suggested corrections.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Trace">
    AI suggests trace links to:
    - Related safety analyses (FMEA failure modes, HARA hazards)
    - Existing requirements at adjacent levels
    - Test cases and verification activities
    - Standards clauses
    
    Select relevant traces to establish traceability.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Conflicts (CSV imports only)">
    For CSV imports, check for conflicts with existing requirements:
    - Duplicate requirement detection
    - Contradictory requirements identification
    - Overlapping scope warnings
  </Step>
  <Step title="Export">
    Import validated requirements to your project database:
    - Full traceability to source document
    - Version control
    - Change tracking
    - Integration with Traceability Matrix
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Classification

### Automatic Classification

Saphira automatically analyzes requirement text to suggest the appropriate classification level:

<img src="/images/requirements-classification-view.png" alt="Requirements Classification View" />

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion icon="brain" title="Classification Analysis">
  The system examines requirement text for:
  - **User Perspective Terms**: user, operator, driver, passenger, customer
  - **Technical Terms**: voltage, current, frequency, bandwidth, latency
  - **System-Level Scope**: system shall, the equipment, overall performance
  - **Component Terms**: ECU, sensor, actuator, module, controller
  - **Subsystem Indicators**: interface, communication, integration, connection
  - **Hardware Terms**: physical, electrical, mechanical, thermal, environmental
  - **Software Terms**: algorithm, function, code, memory, processing
</Accordion>

<Accordion icon="lightbulb" title="Dynamic Recommendations">
  Based on analysis, Saphira provides recommendations:
  
  For **Stakeholder Level**:
  - Add user perspective terms
  - Remove technical implementation details
  - Broaden scope to system-level concerns
  
  For **System Level**:
  - Add system-level scope indicators
  - Remove component-specific details
  - Add technical terms for specificity
  
  For **Component Level**:
  - Add component-specific terms
  - Narrow scope to component concerns
  - Include measurable parameters
</Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

## INCOSE Linting

### Quality Checking

Saphira provides automated requirement quality checking against INCOSE best practices:

<img src="/images/INCOSE-Linting-view.png" alt="INCOSE Linting View" />

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion icon="check" title="INCOSE Principles">
  Requirements are checked against:
  - **Atomicity**: One capability per requirement
  - **Verifiability**: Testable with single procedure
  - **Clarity**: No ambiguous terms (avoid "appropriate", "adequate")
  - **Single Safe State**: One safe state per requirement
  - **Shall Statements**: Active voice with "shall"
</Accordion>

<Accordion icon="wand-magic-sparkles" title="Suggested Rewrites">
  When issues are detected:
  - Specific suggestions for improvement
  - Before/after comparisons
  - Rationale for each suggestion
  - One-click apply to update requirement text
</Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

### Requirement Quality Rules

| Principle | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Atomicity** | One capability per requirement | ✅ "System shall detect obstacles" |
| **Verifiability** | Testable with single procedure | ✅ "Response time shall be ≤100ms" |
| **Clarity** | No ambiguous terms | ❌ Avoid "appropriate", "adequate" |
| **Single Safe State** | One safe state per requirement | ✅ "System shall enter safe state A" |
| **Shall Statements** | Active voice with "shall" | ✅ "The system shall provide..." |

## Traceability

### Automatic Trace Suggestions

When creating requirements, Saphira suggests traces to:

- **Safety Analyses**: FMEA failure modes, HARA hazards, TARA assets
- **Existing Requirements**: Requirements at adjacent levels in the hierarchy
- **Test Cases**: Verification activities and test procedures
- **Standards Clauses**: Relevant standards and compliance requirements

<img src="/images/reqs-tracing-view.png" alt="Automatic Trace View" />

### Traceability Matrix Integration

After saving requirements, view them in the Traceability Matrix:

- Parent-child decomposition trees
- Cross-level traceability
- Verification coverage analysis
- Gap identification for missing traces

## Import Sources

### Manual Entry

Type or paste requirement text directly into the input field. Best for:
- Single requirements
- Quick requirement entry
- Requirements from external sources

### CSV Import

Import requirements from CSV files with:
- Requirement IDs and descriptions
- Parent-child relationships
- Classification levels
- Additional metadata

The workflow includes conflict checking for CSV imports to detect duplicates and contradictions.

### Jama Connect

Import requirements directly from Jama Connect:
- Automatic synchronization
- Requirement metadata preservation
- Traceability link maintenance

### Extracted Requirements

After extracting requirements from PDFs or images, use Write & Check to:
- Classify extracted requirements
- Validate quality with INCOSE linting
- Establish traceability links
- Import to project database

## Post-Export Workflow

After exporting requirements, you can:

- **View in Traceability Matrix**: See your requirements in the full traceability context
- **Extract More Requirements**: Continue extracting from additional documents
- **Run Safety Analysis**: Use requirements for FMEA, HARA, or TARA analysis
- **Generate V&V Plan**: Create verification and validation plans
- **Build Safety Case**: Create GSN safety case structures

<img src="/images/extracted-requirements-export-options-view.png" alt="Extracted Requirements Export Options View" />

## Integration with Safety Workflows

Refined requirements integrate directly with Saphira's safety analysis:

- **FMEA**: Requirements become focus elements for failure mode analysis
- **HARA**: Requirements populate hazard sources and control measures
- **TARA**: Interface definitions feed cybersecurity asset identification
- **Gap Analysis**: Extracted specifications enable automated standards compliance checking
- **Safety Case**: Requirements become evidence in GSN safety arguments
