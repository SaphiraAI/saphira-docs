## GSN Safety Case Overview

Saphira automatically generates Goal Structuring Notation (GSN) safety cases that demonstrate your system meets safety requirements through structured Goal → Strategy → Evidence chains—required for Proof of Validity (PoV) acceptance and regulatory approval.

### GSN Node Types

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion icon="bullseye" title="Goals (G)">
  High-level safety claims to be demonstrated:
  - Root goal: Overall system safety claim
  - Sub-goals: Decomposed safety objectives
  - Clear, measurable safety statements
  
  **Example**: "G1: The system is safe and reliable in all operational conditions"
</Accordion>

<Accordion icon="route" title="Strategies (S)">
  How goals are argued to be satisfied:
  - Argument approaches and methodologies
  - Decomposition rationale
  - Evidence grouping logic
  
  **Example**: "S1: Argue based on hazard analysis and mitigation coverage"
</Accordion>

<Accordion icon="lightbulb" title="Solutions (SOL)">
  Specific evidence supporting the argument:
  - Requirements that address safety
  - Test results and analyses
  - Design documentation

  **Example**: "SOL1: REQ-SAFETY-001 - Emergency stop response ≤500ms"
</Accordion>

<Accordion icon="circle-question" title="Assumptions (A)">
  Key assumptions underlying the safety argument:
  - Operational assumptions
  - Environmental assumptions
  - User behavior assumptions
  - System boundary assumptions
  
  **Example**: "A1: Operators are trained per procedure OPS-001"
</Accordion>

<Accordion icon="file-contract" title="Evidence (E)">
  Types of evidence required to support claims:
  - Test reports
  - Analysis results
  - Certifications

</Accordion>

<Accordion icon="circle-info" title="Context (C)">
  Contextual information for the argument:
  - System description
