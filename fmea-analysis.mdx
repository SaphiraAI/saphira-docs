## FMEA Workflow Overview

Saphira's FMEA Workflow provides a guided, four-phase process for conducting comprehensive Failure Mode and Effects Analysis with AI-assisted failure mode generation, automatic risk priority calculations, and architecture-aware context.

Access the FMEA Workflow from the **Dashboard** by clicking **Run Safety Analysis** and then **FMEA**.

## Workflow Phases

The FMEA Workflow consists of four sequential phases:

<img src="/images/fmea-workflow-overview.png" alt="FMEA Workflow Overview" />

<Steps>
  <Step title="Reference Documents">
    Upload existing FMEA spreadsheets, specifications, or reference material
  </Step>
  <Step title="Item Selection">
    Select or create systems, subsystems, and components for analysis
  </Step>
  <Step title="FMEA Configuration">
    Choose template type and configure columns for generation
  </Step>
  <Step title="FMEA Generation">
    Generate failure modes with AI assistance and review results
  </Step>
</Steps>

---

## Phase 1: Reference Documents

Upload existing documentation to enrich the FMEA generation with context.

<Accordion icon="upload" title="Upload Reference Documents">
  **Purpose**: Provide context and extract existing data to inform failure mode generation.
  
  **Supported Uploads**:
  - **Existing FMEA Spreadsheets**: Import past FMEA data to build upon
  - **Technical Specifications**: System specs for architecture context
  - **Item Definitions**: System/component definitions
  - **Architecture Diagrams**: Visual system structure
  
  **Upload Types**:
  - **Item Definitions**: Documents describing system structure
  - **Past FMEA**: Existing FMEA spreadsheets to extract and continue
  
  Documents auto-populate systems and components, providing architecture context for AI-assisted generation.
</Accordion>

### Extraction Options

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Extract Item Definitions" icon="cube">
    Upload system specifications to extract:
    - System hierarchy
    - Component lists
    - Interfaces and connections
    - Operating modes
  </Card>
  <Card title="Extract Past FMEA" icon="table">
    Upload existing FMEA to extract:
    - Previous failure modes
    - Historical S/O/D ratings
    - Existing controls
    - Action items
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

---

## Phase 2: Item Selection

Select or create the items to analyze. Items are organized hierarchically.

<Accordion icon="database" title="Select Analysis Items">
  **Hierarchy Levels**:
  - **System**: Top-level system (e.g., "Brake Control System")
  - **Subsystem**: Major subsystems (e.g., "Hydraulic Unit", "ECU")
  - **Sub-subsystem**: Lower-level groupings
  - **Component**: Individual components (e.g., "Pressure Sensor", "Valve")
  
  **Item Selector Features**:
  - View all items from project data
  - Filter by hierarchy level
  - Search by name
  - Create new items inline
  - Items extracted from documents appear here automatically
</Accordion>

### Item Context

When you select an item, Saphira loads its context:
- **Function**: What the item does
- **Interfaces**: Connections to other items
- **Operating Modes**: Normal, maintenance, degraded states
- **System Boundary**: Scope of analysis

This context informs AI-generated failure modes with architecture-aware suggestions.
