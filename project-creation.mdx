# Project Creation Flow

This guide provides a detailed walkthrough of how projects are created and initialized in Saphira Server.

## Project Structure

When a new project is created in Saphira, the following structure is automatically generated:

```
project_name/
├── config/
│   ├── standards/         # Standards configuration
│   └── risk_matrix.json   # Risk assessment matrix configuration
├── data/
│   ├── hazards/          # Hazard analysis data
│   ├── controls/         # Control measures
│   └── safety_functions/ # Safety function definitions
└── validation/
    ├── test_plans/       # Verification and validation test plans
    └── evidence/         # Test evidence and documentation
```

## Creation Process

### 1. Project Initialization

When creating a new project, the following steps occur:

1. **Project Configuration**
   - Basic project metadata is collected
   - Project type and applicable standards are selected
   - Risk assessment methodology is configured

2. **Database Setup**
   - Project schema is initialized
   - Required collections are created
   - Initial indexes are built for efficient querying

3. **Standards Integration**
   - Selected standards are loaded from the standards database
   - Relevant requirements are mapped to the project
   - Compliance frameworks are initialized

### 2. Initial Setup

After project creation, several automatic processes are triggered:

1. **Risk Assessment Framework**
   - Risk matrix is configured based on selected methodology
   - Severity and probability levels are defined
   - Risk categories and acceptance criteria are established

2. **Document Management**
   - Document storage structure is initialized
   - Version control system is set up
   - Traceability links are prepared

3. **User Access**
   - Project roles are defined
   - Initial permissions are set
   - Collaboration features are enabled

### 3. AI Integration Setup

The following AI capabilities are configured:

1. **Hazard Analysis**
   - AI models for hazard identification are initialized
   - Domain-specific knowledge bases are loaded
   - Analysis templates are prepared

2. **Standards Compliance**
   - Regulatory requirements are mapped
   - Compliance checking rules are configured
   - Automatic validation criteria are set up

### 4. Integration Points

Saphira Server establishes connections with:

1. **External Systems**
   - Version control systems
   - Document management systems
   - Test management platforms
   - CI/CD pipelines

2. **Safety Tools**
   - SISTEMA integration for safety function validation
   - Risk assessment tools
   - Verification and validation frameworks

## Post-Creation Configuration

After the initial setup, users can:

1. **Customize Settings**
   - Modify risk assessment parameters
   - Configure additional standards
   - Adjust validation criteria
   - Set up custom fields

2. **Import Existing Data**
   - Import hazard analyses from spreadsheets
   - Upload existing safety documentation
   - Import control measures
   - Migrate legacy data

3. **Setup Automation**
   - Configure automatic hazard identification
   - Set up compliance checking
   - Enable automatic documentation generation
   - Configure validation workflows

## Best Practices

1. **Initial Configuration**
   - Review and adjust risk matrix settings
   - Verify standards selection
   - Configure project-specific fields
   - Set up user roles and permissions

2. **Data Organization**
   - Use consistent naming conventions
   - Organize hazards by system components
   - Group related control measures
   - Maintain clear traceability

3. **Integration Setup**
   - Configure necessary external tool connections
   - Set up document management integration
   - Enable required AI features
   - Verify automation workflows

## Troubleshooting

Common issues during project creation and their solutions:

1. **Configuration Issues**
   - Verify standards selection
   - Check risk matrix configuration
   - Validate user permissions
   - Review integration settings

2. **Data Import Problems**
   - Validate data format
   - Check file permissions
   - Verify import mappings
   - Review error logs

3. **Integration Errors**
   - Verify connection settings
   - Check API access
   - Validate credentials
   - Review system logs
