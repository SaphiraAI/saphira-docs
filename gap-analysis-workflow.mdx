## Overview

Gap Analysis in Saphira helps you identify compliance gaps between your project documentation and regulatory standards. This workflow guides you through starting a gap analysis job, monitoring its progress, viewing results, and generating actionable insights including Executive Summaries, Action Items (TODOs), and Product Requirements Documents (PRD).

<Info>
  **Note for Saphira Team Users**: If you're working with the Saphira team to run a job, they may have re-run it under a different name. Please check the "Ongoing Gap Analysis Jobs" section to see all active and completed jobs.
</Info>

## Starting a Gap Analysis

### Step 1: Select Standards

Before running a gap analysis, you need to select which compliance standards to analyze against.

1. Navigate to the **Gap Analysis** page from your project dashboard
2. If no standards are selected, you'll see a notification banner prompting you to select standards
3. Use the **Standards Selection** interface to choose the compliance frameworks that apply to your project
4. Click **Save** to persist your selection

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="check-circle" title="Standards Selection">
    The standards selection interface shows:
    - Available compliance frameworks for your project
    - Data quality indicators (✅ valid & ready, 🔴 schema issues, ⚠️ metadata only)
    - Clause counts for each standard
    - Schema validation status
    
    <img src="/images/gap-analysis-standards-selection.png" alt="Standards Selection Interface" />
    
    Only standards marked as "✅ valid & ready" can be used for gap analysis. Standards with schema issues may still work but could cause errors during analysis.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Step 2: Configure Analysis

Once standards are selected, you can configure and start a new gap analysis job.

1. Click **"Run Gap Analysis"** or navigate to the **Gap Analysis** tab
2. Configure your analysis:
   - **Analysis Name** (optional): Give your analysis a descriptive name
   - **Analysis Stage**: Choose the focus area:
     - **All Stages**: Analyze all aspects (design, testing, documentation)
     - **Design Stage**: Focus on design compliance
     - **Design - Software/Firmware**: Software and firmware design compliance
     - **Design - Hardware**: Hardware design compliance
     - **Test Stage**: Analyze test evidence
     - **Documentation Stage**: Assess documentation sufficiency
   - **Select Standards**: Choose which standards to analyze (from your saved selection)
   - **Select Clauses**: Optionally filter to specific clauses within each standard

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="settings" title="Clause Selection">
    You can:
    - Use **"Select All"** to include all clauses from selected standards
    - Filter by classification (Process, Product, Test, Definition) using the global exclude filter
    - Manually select specific clauses for each standard
    - View clause counts and data quality indicators
    
    <img src="/images/gap-analysis-clause-selection.png" alt="Clause Selection Interface" />
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Step 3: Start the Analysis

1. Review your selected clauses (shown in the button: "X clause(s) selected")
2. Click **"Start Gap Analysis"**
3. You'll be redirected to the results page where you can monitor progress

<Warning>
  Large analyses with many clauses may take significant time to complete. The progress bar shows real-time completion status.
</Warning>

## Monitoring Analysis Progress

    - **Slow Generation**: Large analyses take time; be patient and check progress regularly
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="refresh" title="Refresh and Retry">
    - Use the **Refresh** button to update results
