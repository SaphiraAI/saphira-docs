## Automated Test Generation

Saphira automatically generates comprehensive test plans that trace directly to requirements, safety analyses, and standards clauses—ensuring complete verification coverage for your safety-critical systems.

### Test Generation Capabilities

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion icon="check-double" title="Requirement-Based Tests">
  Generate tests directly from requirements:
  - Each requirement gets one or more test cases
  - Tests verify specific requirement criteria
  - Automatic traceability links established
  - Coverage tracking for all requirements
</Accordion>

<Accordion icon="shield-halved" title="Safety Analysis Tests">
  Generate tests from safety artifacts:
  - **HARA Tests**: Verify hazard mitigations
  - **FMEA Tests**: Verify failure mode detection/prevention
  - **TARA Tests**: Verify cybersecurity controls
  - **FTA Tests**: Verify fault handling
</Accordion>

<Accordion icon="book" title="Standards-Based Tests">
  Generate tests from standards clauses:
  - Tests aligned with verification methods
  - Acceptance criteria from standards
  - Evidence requirements identified
  - Compliance demonstration support
</Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

## Test Case Structure

### Generated Test Case Fields

    Requirement: REQ-SAFETY-001
    Test Level: System
    ASIL: C
    """
    # Test setup
    system = initialize_system()
    
    # Preconditions
    assert system.state == OperatingState.NORMAL
    
    # Test execution
    start_time = time.perf_counter()
    system.trigger_emergency_stop()
    
    # Wait for safe state
    while system.state != SafeState.STOPPED:
        if time.perf_counter() - start_time > 0.6:  # 600ms timeout
            break
    
    response_time = time.perf_counter() - start_time
    
    # Assertions
