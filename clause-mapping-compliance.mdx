## Compliance Tracker Overview

Saphira's Compliance Tracker provides a structured, step-by-step workflow for mapping your project documentation against safety standards clauses—generating audit-ready compliance reports that demonstrate regulatory conformance.

**Entry Point**: `Dashboard → Compliance Tracker` or dedicated Compliance Tracker application

### Workflow Navigation

The Compliance Tracker uses a sidebar-based navigation with five main sections:

| Tab | Purpose | Key Actions |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| **Dashboard** | Overview & statistics | View compliance progress, quick actions |
| **Survey** | Applicability assessment | Answer questions to filter relevant clauses |
| **Clauses** | Clause-by-clause compliance | Review, document, test each clause |
| **Documents** | Centralized evidence management | Upload mandatory ISO documents |
| **Tests** | Test execution & evidence | Track test status and upload evidence |
| **Report** | Audit-ready exports | Generate PDF, CSV, JSON reports |

---

## Phase 1: Dashboard Overview

The Dashboard provides an executive summary of your compliance status.

### Compliance Statistics

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion icon="chart-pie" title="Progress Metrics">
  Real-time statistics showing:
  
  - **Compliance Percentage**: Overall progress (e.g., 65%)
  - **Compliant**: Clauses fully satisfied with evidence
  - **In Progress**: Clauses currently being addressed
  - **Pending**: Clauses awaiting review
  - **Not Started**: Clauses not yet addressed
  
  Progress bar visualizes completion status at a glance.
</Accordion>

<Accordion icon="list-check" title="Quick Actions">
  From the dashboard:
  
  - **Continue Survey**: Resume applicability questionnaire
  - **View Pending Clauses**: Jump to incomplete clauses
  - **Generate Report**: Quick export of current status
  - **Ask an Expert**: Get guidance on complex clauses
</Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

---

## Phase 2: Applicability Survey

The Survey phase helps you identify which clauses apply to your specific product or system, reducing compliance scope to only relevant requirements.

### How the Survey Works

<Steps>

<Step title="Load Survey Scenario (Optional)">
  Pre-configured scenarios for common product types:
  - Industrial robot applications
  - Autonomous mobile robots (AMRs)
  - Agricultural machinery
  - Custom product type
  
  Loading a scenario pre-fills answers based on typical configurations.
</Step>

<Step title="Answer Applicability Questions">
  For each question:
  
  1. Read the question (e.g., "Does your truck operate in outdoor environments?")
  2. Click **Yes** or **No**
  3. Related clauses are automatically shown/hidden based on your answer
  
  Each question displays affected clause IDs (e.g., "Affects 12 clauses: 4.1, 4.2.1, 4.3...")
</Step>

<Step title="Review Survey Impact">
  Survey Impact Statistics card shows:
  
  | Metric | Description |
  |--------|-------------|
  | **Questions Answered** | X/Y questions complete (e.g., 15/20) |
  | **Applicable Clauses** | Number of clauses you must address |
  | **Non-Applicable** | Clauses hidden based on survey |
  | **Total Clauses** | Full count in the standard |
</Step>

<Step title="Complete Survey">
  Click **Complete Survey →** to proceed to clause assessment.
  
  You can return to modify survey answers at any time—clause filtering updates automatically.
</Step>

</Steps>

### Survey Answer Tags

Each survey question is linked to tags that match clause relevance:
- `outdoor_operation` → outdoor-related clauses
- `navigation_sensor` → sensor-specific requirements
- `human_interaction` → human-machine interface clauses
- `baseline` → always-applicable core requirements

---

## Phase 3: Clause-by-Clause Compliance

The Clauses tab is where you manage compliance for each applicable requirement.
