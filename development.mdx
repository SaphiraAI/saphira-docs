### Find Similar Measures and Filter Graph View

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="github" title="Find Similar Measures">
    Use the Find Similar action on Control Measures to identify other controls across the project which seem similar and should be consolidated.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="rectangle-terminal" title="Filter Graph View">
    In the "Trace Graph" tab, you can filter the hierarchy by properties during review, such as high Residual Risk.

### Add and generate validation information

<AccordionGroup>

  <Accordion icon="message-bot" title="Add validation information">
    You can add validation information to a Control Measure or Safety Function by clicking the "Create Test Plan" button on the "Tests" tab from Table or Trace Graph views.
    <img src="/images/add-validation.png" />
    You can add any test or verification test here, and can also append programmatically.
    <img src="/images/create-test-plan.png" />
    For example, see this Verification & Validation Checklist that was generated for a sample requirement in a demo project using the "Generate Validation & Verification" button under Actions:
    <img src="/images/sample-test-plan.png" />
    Furthermore, you can add or view automatically identified traceability from these control measures, requirements, and safety functions into arbitrary links, such as from your codebase, 
    design document store, task management system, or even the open Internet.
    <img src="/images/traceability.png" />
    Next up, you can associate particular safety function architecture using SISTEMA VDMA libraries in the Safety Functions view.
    <img src="/images/safety-function-architecture.png" />
    You can also add arbitrary additional fields to any item to store inline, such as Residual Risk notes:
    <img src="/images/residual-risk-notes.png" />
    Any fields that were generated automatically are highlighted in yellow until acked by a reviewer.
    <img src="/images/unacked-field.png" />
    Finally, when you're done with all necessary review, you can mark the assessment as "Validated" to indicate that the assessment is ready to be used in a safety case, which will lock it to future edits.

## Export CE Mark Technical Files & UL Certification Reports

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion icon="message-bot" title="Export CE Mark Technical Files & UL Certification Reports">
  You can export complete CE Mark Technical Files and UL certification reports from the "Export Requirements" dropdown in Table View.
  <img src="/images/export-notified-body-report.png" />
  For example, this is the default export format:
  <img src="/images/notified-body-report.png" />
  And here's the expected output by Pilz:
  <img src="/images/pilz-report.png" />
  Saphira generates comprehensive documentation including:
  - Complete CE Mark Technical File structure
  - UL Mark certification documentation
  - Machinery Directive 2006/42/EC compliance
  - Low Voltage Directive 2014/35/EU compliance
  - EMC Directive 2014/30/EU compliance
  - Notified body reports (UL, TUV, Intertek, Pilz)
