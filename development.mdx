### Generate risk assessment

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion icon="message-bot" title="Generate upon project creation">
  When creating a new project, specify tasks for which to infer hazards based on the configured standards.

</Accordion>
<Accordion icon="rocket" title="Trigger automatically for manually entered hazards">
  After entering hazards manually, you can trigger analysis by clicking the "Infer Field" button under Actions 
  after checking the box next to the hazards to analyze.

<Accordion icon="message-bot" title="Enter and associate with hazards">
  You can enter and associate control measures with hazards in the Control Measures view of the Compliance Dashboard.

</Accordion>
<Accordion icon="rocket" title="Aggregate control measures into safety functions">
  Many control measures may be similar, so should be associated with the same safety function, which can be associated with specific architecture.
