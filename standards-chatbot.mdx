### Intelligent Standards Retrieval

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion icon="message-bot" title="Automatic Standard Identification">
  SaphiraGPT intelligently determines which standard is most relevant to your question. For example, asking "What are the safety requirements for emergency stops?" will automatically identify and search through relevant standards like ISO 14120 or ISO 3691.
  The system provides responses with specific citations including page numbers, sections, and clauses to ensure compliance accuracy.
</Accordion>
<Accordion icon="rocket" title="Context-Aware Responses">
  The chatbot maintains conversation context, allowing you to ask follow-up questions and get increasingly specific answers. It can cross-reference multiple standards when your question spans different regulations.
  Responses include confidence levels and alternative standards that might be relevant to your query.
</Accordion>
<Accordion icon="github" title="Document Filtering">
  Use the document filter dropdown to search within specific standards or across all uploaded documents. This is particularly useful when you know which standard contains the information you need.
  You can also filter by specific pages within documents for even more targeted searches.

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion icon="message-bot" title="Effective Questioning">
  Be specific in your questions to get the most accurate responses. Instead of "What are the safety requirements?", ask "What are the safety requirements for emergency stop devices in ISO 14120?" or "What are the CE Mark Technical File requirements for machinery under the Machinery Directive?"
  Use follow-up questions to dive deeper into specific clauses or requirements.
</Accordion>
<Accordion icon="rocket" title="Verification and Validation">
  Always verify critical compliance information by checking the cited sections and clauses in the original standards documents.
  Use the confidence levels provided in responses to assess the reliability of the information.
</Accordion>
<Accordion icon="github" title="Conversation Management">
  Save important conversations for future reference and compliance documentation.
  Export key responses and citations for inclusion in your safety case or compliance reports.
