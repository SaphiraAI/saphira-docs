## Importing Components

The Components tab supports multiple import methods:

### BOM Spreadsheet Import

1. Click the **Import** button
2. Select **BOM Spreadsheet**
3. Upload an XLSX or XLS file
4. The system automatically detects column headers and imports components

### Document/Image Import

1. Click the **Import** button
2. Select **Document/Image**
3. Navigate to the Reference Document Automation workflow
4. Import components from uploaded documents or images

### Schematic Import

1. Click the **Import** button
2. Select **Schematic Import**
3. Choose a schematic document from your project files
4. The system analyzes the schematic and imports missing components
5. Only numeric part numbers are captured (alphanumeric references like R1, C1 are ignored)

Supported schematic formats:
- PDF files
- PNG/JPG images
- KiCad schematic files (.sch, .kicad)
- Files with "schematic" in the filename

## UL Compliance Checking

### Running Compliance Checks

The Components tab includes automated UL compliance checking:

1. Click **Run UL Compliance Check**
2. Choose between two methods:

#### AI Analysis (Recommended)
- Uses advanced AI to analyze component data
- More accurate and faster than web scraping
- Determines UL compliance status automatically

#### Automated Web Scraping
- Automatically searches UL databases and websites
- May take longer than AI analysis
- Less reliable than AI analysis

### Compliance Check Behavior

- Only components that haven't been marked as compliant are checked
- The check respects current table filters
- You'll see a confirmation dialog showing how many components will be checked
- Results are updated automatically after the check completes

### Compliance Status Indicators

Components display color-coded compliance status:
- **Green**: Listed/Compliant
- **Yellow**: Recognized
- **Red**: Not Compliant/Unknown

## Editing Components

### Inline Editing

Most fields in the components table can be edited directly:
1. Click on any editable cell
2. Make your changes
3. Press Enter or click outside the cell to save

### Notes Editing

Notes fields use a popup editor for longer text:
1. Click on a Notes cell
2. A larger text editor opens
3. Enter your notes
4. Save your changes

## Component Selection and Deletion

### Selecting Components

- Click on rows to select individual components
- Use checkboxes for multiple selection
- Selected components are highlighted

### Deleting Components

#### Delete Selected Components
1. Select one or more components
2. Click **Delete Selected**
3. Confirm the deletion
4. Selected components are permanently removed

#### Delete All Components
1. Click **Delete All**
2. Confirm the action (double confirmation required)
3. **Warning**: This permanently deletes ALL components and cannot be undone

## Exporting Components

### Export to Excel

1. Click **Export XLSX**
2. The system generates an Excel file with all component data
3. The file is automatically downloaded

The exported file includes:
- All component details
- UL compliance information
- Project management fields
- Additional notes and remarks

## Table Features

## Best Practices

### Component Organization

1. **Use Descriptive Names**: Choose clear, descriptive component names
2. **Complete All Fields**: Fill in as much information as possible for better tracking
3. **Regular Updates**: Keep component information current
4. **Status Tracking**: Update component status as work progresses

### Import Workflows

1. **Start with BOM**: Import your Bill of Materials first
2. **Supplement with Schematics**: Use schematic import to catch missing components
3. **Verify Imports**: Review imported components for accuracy
4. **Manual Additions**: Add any missing components manually

### Compliance Management

1. **Run Regular Checks**: Periodically run UL compliance checks
2. **Review Results**: Verify compliance status for all components
3. **Attach Documentation**: Link UL PDFs when available
4. **Track Updates**: Monitor compliance update timestamps

### Data Management

1. **Regular Exports**: Export component data regularly as backups
2. **Version Control**: Use revision fields to track component versions
3. **Notes**: Document important information in notes fields
4. **Validation**: Use validation notes for compliance tracking

## Troubleshooting

### Import Issues

**Problem**: BOM import fails or shows errors
- **Solution**: Verify file format is XLSX or XLS
- **Solution**: Check that column headers are present
- **Solution**: Ensure file is not corrupted

**Problem**: Schematic import doesn't find components
- **Solution**: Verify schematic file format is supported
- **Solution**: Check that part numbers are visible in the schematic
- **Solution**: Ensure schematic is uploaded to project documents first

### Compliance Check Issues

**Problem**: Compliance check doesn't run
- **Solution**: Verify components are selected/filtered correctly
- **Solution**: Check that components need compliance checking (not already marked compliant)
- **Solution**: Ensure project ID is valid

**Problem**: Compliance results are incorrect
- **Solution**: Verify component manufacturer and part number information
- **Solution**: Try running AI analysis instead of web scraping
- **Solution**: Manually update compliance status if needed

### Display Issues

**Problem**: Components table doesn't load
- **Solution**: Refresh the page
- **Solution**: Check browser console for errors
- **Solution**: Verify project ID is correct

**Problem**: Columns are too narrow/wide
- **Solution**: Resize columns by dragging borders
- **Solution**: Use "Size Columns to Fit" option
- **Solution**: Reset column widths in column management panel
