## Cybersecurity Threat Analysis & Risk Assessment (TARA)

Learn how to use Saphira to perform comprehensive cybersecurity threat analysis and risk assessment (TARA) for automotive systems! Saphira implements the complete ISO 21434 cybersecurity workflow, enabling automated threat identification, risk assessment, and security requirement generation.

### What is TARA?

TARA (Threat Analysis and Risk Assessment) is a systematic process for identifying and evaluating cybersecurity threats to automotive systems according to ISO 21434. Saphira provides an AI-powered workflow that guides you through the complete cybersecurity engineering process:

- **Asset Identification**: Identify cybersecurity-critical assets in your system
- **Threat Analysis**: Discover potential threat scenarios and attack vectors
- **Risk Assessment**: Evaluate the impact and feasibility of identified threats
- **Security Goals**: Define cybersecurity goals to mitigate threats
- **Security Requirements**: Generate detailed technical security requirements
- **Security Controls**: Specify security controls and countermeasures

## Getting Started with TARA

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="database" title="Define Item and Identify Assets">
    Start by defining your system (item definition) and identifying cybersecurity assets. Saphira analyzes your system architecture, interfaces, and components to automatically identify:
    - Hardware components with cybersecurity relevance
    - Software modules handling sensitive data
    - Communication interfaces and protocols
    - Data assets requiring protection (CIA triad: Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="shield-alert" title="Perform Threat Analysis">
    Saphira automatically generates threat scenarios based on your identified assets using STRIDE methodology and ISO 21434 guidance:
    - Spoofing attacks
    - Tampering with data or code
    - Repudiation threats
    - Information disclosure
    - Denial of service
    - Elevation of privilege
    
    Each threat scenario includes attack vectors, potential impact, and technical details.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="chart-line" title="Assess Risk Levels">
    For each identified threat, Saphira evaluates:
    - **Impact Rating**: Potential damage to safety, privacy, financial, or operational aspects
    - **Attack Feasibility**: Required expertise, time, equipment, and opportunity
    - **CAL (Cybersecurity Assurance Level)**: Automatic calculation based on ISO 21434 risk matrix
    
    Risk levels guide prioritization of security efforts.
