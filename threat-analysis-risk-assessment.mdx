## Cybersecurity Threat Analysis & Risk Assessment (TARA)

Learn how to use Saphira to perform comprehensive cybersecurity threat analysis and risk assessment (TARA) for automotive systems! Saphira implements the complete ISO/SAE 21434:2021 cybersecurity workflow, enabling automated threat identification, risk assessment, and security requirement generation.

### What is TARA?

TARA (Threat Analysis and Risk Assessment) is a systematic process for identifying and evaluating cybersecurity threats to automotive systems according to ISO/SAE 21434:2021. Saphira provides an AI-powered workflow that guides you through the complete cybersecurity engineering process following Clause 9 (Concept) and Clause 15 (TARA Methods):

- **Item Definition**: Define your system, interfaces, and operational context
- **Asset Identification**: Identify cybersecurity-critical assets and their properties
- **Damage Scenarios**: Determine potential damage if assets are compromised
- **Threat Scenarios**: Discover threat scenarios and attack vectors using STRIDE
- **Attack Path Analysis**: Map attack paths from entry points to target assets
- **Attack Feasibility Rating**: Evaluate attacker capability requirements
- **Impact Rating**: Assess safety, financial, operational, and privacy impacts
- **Risk Value Determination**: Calculate risk levels using the ISO 21434 matrix
- **Risk Treatment Decision**: Decide on risk treatment options (avoid, reduce, share, retain)
- **Cybersecurity Goals**: Define goals to mitigate identified risks
- **Cybersecurity Claims**: Document claims supporting your cybersecurity case
- **Cybersecurity Requirements**: Generate detailed technical security requirements

## Getting Started with TARA
