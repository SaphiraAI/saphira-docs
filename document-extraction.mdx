## Extract Requirements Overview

Saphira's **Extract Requirements** feature uses advanced OCR, NLP, and Vision Language Models (VLMs) to automatically extract requirements, components, and technical specifications from your source materials with high accuracy.

## Getting Started

From the Dashboard, navigate to the **Seek Guidance** section and click **Extract Requirements**.

<img src="/images/extract-requirements-card.png" alt="Extract Requirements Card" />

This opens the extraction method selection dialog where you choose how to extract requirements from your source material.

  Extract from system architecture diagrams:
  - Component names and their roles (ECU, function, subsystem, system, process)
  - Connections and data flows between components
  - System boundaries and interfaces
  - Hierarchical structure
  
  The VLM automatically:
  - Detects if an image is an architecture diagram (with confidence scoring)
  - Extracts every labeled element
  - Identifies relationships between components
</Accordion>

<Accordion icon="sitemap" title="Block Diagrams & Flowcharts">
  Extract from visual diagrams:
  - Process steps and decision points

</AccordionGroup>

### Image Extraction Workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select Extract from Image">
    From the extraction method dialog, click **Extract from Image**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Upload Your Image">
    Upload architecture diagrams, screenshots, or images (PNG, JPG, PDF)
  </Step>
  <Step title="VLM Analyzes Image">
    Saphira's Vision Language Model:
    - Detects document type (diagram, chart, table, screenshot)
    - Extracts all visible text
    - Identifies technical components and relationships
    - Generates searchable keywords
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review Extracted Content">
    Review the structured extraction:

  </Step>
</Steps>

### Architecture Diagram Processing

When you upload an architecture diagram, Saphira:

1. **Diagram Detection**: Uses VLM to identify the image type with confidence scoring
2. **Component Enumeration**: Extracts every labeled element:
   - Component names from diagram labels
   - Role classification (ECU, function, subsystem, system, process)
   - Brief descriptions of purpose and connections
3. **Relationship Mapping**: Identifies connections and data flows
4. **Context Integration**: Combines with item definition for complete system understanding

## Extraction Accuracy

### >90% Accuracy Target

Saphira uses a multi-pass extraction approach to achieve high accuracy:

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion icon="search" title="Pass 1: Initial Extraction">
  - Document/image structure analysis
  - Primary content extraction
  - Initial requirement identification
  - Component detection from diagrams
</Accordion>

<Accordion icon="crosshairs" title="Pass 2: Refinement">
  - Cross-validation of extracted content
  - Relationship verification
  - Missing field detection
  - Confidence scoring
</Accordion>

<Accordion icon="check-double" title="Pass 3: Validation">
  - Format normalization
  - ID standardization
  - Traceability link verification
  - Quality assurance checks
</Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

### Accuracy by Source Type

| Source Type | Accuracy Target | Key Features |
|-------------|-----------------|--------------|
| PDF Requirements | >90% | Hierarchical extraction, ID preservation |
| Architecture Diagrams | >85% | VLM component detection, relationship mapping |
| BOMs/Spreadsheets | >95% | Column auto-detection, format normalization |
| Screenshots | >85% | OCR text extraction, table detection |
| Schematics | >80% | Part number extraction, symbol recognition |

### Maximizing Accuracy

To get the best extraction results:

1. **Use High-Resolution Images**: Clear, high-resolution images yield better VLM analysis
2. **Well-Formatted Documents**: Documents with consistent formatting extract more accurately
3. **Clear Labels**: Diagrams with readable labels improve component detection
4. **Review and Edit**: Use the inline editor to refine extracted content

## Post-Extraction Workflow

After extraction, requirements flow through:

```
Extract → Classify → INCOSE Lint → Suggest Children → Push to RM
```

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion icon="tags" title="Classify">
  AI automatically suggests requirement classification level:
  - Stakeholder
  - System
  - Subsystem
  - Component
  - Hardware/Software
</Accordion>

<Accordion icon="check" title="INCOSE Lint">
  Quality check against INCOSE requirements engineering principles:
  - Atomicity (single capability per requirement)
  - Verifiability (testable with single procedure)
  - Clarity (no ambiguous terms)
  - Suggested rewrites for improvement
</Accordion>

<Accordion icon="sitemap" title="Suggest Children">
  AI suggests child requirements for decomposition:
  - Hierarchical breakdown
  - Component allocation
  - Traceability maintained
</Accordion>

<Accordion icon="database" title="Push to RM">
  Import to project requirements database:
  - Full traceability to source document
  - Version control
  - Change tracking
</Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

## Integration with Safety Workflows

Extracted requirements and components integrate directly with Saphira's safety analysis:

- **FMEA**: Extracted components become focus elements for failure mode analysis
- **HARA**: Requirements populate hazard sources and control measures
- **TARA**: Interface definitions feed cybersecurity asset identification
- **Gap Analysis**: Extracted specifications enable automated standards compliance checking
- **Safety Case**: Requirements become evidence in GSN safety arguments
