## Extract Requirements Overview

Saphira's **Extract Requirements** feature uses advanced OCR, NLP, and Vision Language Models (VLMs) to automatically extract requirements, components, and technical specifications from your source materials with high accuracy.

## Getting Started

From the Home Page, navigate to the **Seek Guidance** section and click **Extract Requirements**, which will lead to this Choose Extraction Method option.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Refine & Import">
    After extraction, use **Write & Check Requirements** to classify, validate, and import to your project database with full traceability
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Extracted Fields

For each requirement, Saphira extracts:

| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **ID** | Unique requirement identifier | `REQ-SAFETY-001` |
| **Requirement** | Full requirement text | "The system shall..." |
| **Parent** | Parent requirement or category | `Safety` |
| **Logical Operator** | Comparison operators | `>=`, `<=`, `within` |
| **Unit** | Measurement unit | `ms`, `°C`, `Gauss` |
| **Value** | Numeric threshold | `500`, `0.20-0.55` |
| **Requirement Type** | Numeric or Textual | `Numeric` |

## Extract from Image

Upload visual content like architecture diagrams and screenshots to extract requirements and system structure.

<img src="/images/extract-image-requirements-view.png" alt="Extract PDFs" />

### Supported Image Types

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion icon="diagram-project" title="Architecture Diagrams">
  Extract from system architecture diagrams:
  - Component names and their roles (ECU, function, subsystem, system, process)
  - Connections and data flows between components
  - System boundaries and interfaces
  - Hierarchical structure
  
  The VLM automatically:
  - Detects if an image is an architecture diagram (with confidence scoring)
  - Extracts every labeled element
  - Identifies relationships between components
</Accordion>

<Accordion icon="sitemap" title="Block Diagrams & Flowcharts">
  Extract from visual diagrams:
  - Process steps and decision points
  - Data flow arrows and connections
  - Functional blocks and modules
  - State transitions
</Accordion>

<Accordion icon="camera" title="Screenshots">
  Extract from captured screenshots:
  - Requirements from legacy systems
  - Tables and structured data
  - Form fields and values
  - Any visible text content
</Accordion>

<Accordion icon="microchip" title="Schematic Drawings">
  Extract from electrical/electronic schematics:
  - Part numbers and component symbols
  - Component values and ratings
  - Connection information
  - Reference designators
</Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

### Image Extraction Workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select Extract from Image">
    From the extraction method dialog, click **Extract from Image**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Upload Your Image">
    Upload architecture diagrams, screenshots, or images (PNG, JPG, PDF)
  </Step>
  <Step title="VLM Analyzes Image">
    Saphira's Vision Language Model:
    - Detects document type (diagram, chart, table, screenshot)
    - Extracts all visible text
    - Identifies technical components and relationships
    - Generates searchable keywords
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review Extracted Content">
    Review the structured extraction:
    - Components with roles and descriptions
    - Requirements derived from visual content
    - Hierarchical relationships
  </Step>
  <Step title="Refine & Import">
    After extraction, use **Write & Check Requirements** to classify, validate, and import to your project database with full traceability
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Architecture Diagram Processing

When you upload an architecture diagram, Saphira:

1. **Diagram Detection**: Uses VLM to identify the image type with confidence scoring
2. **Component Enumeration**: Extracts every labeled element:
   - Component names from diagram labels
   - Role classification (ECU, function, subsystem, system, process)
   - Brief descriptions of purpose and connections
3. **Relationship Mapping**: Identifies connections and data flows
4. **Context Integration**: Combines with item definition for complete system understanding

## Extraction Accuracy

### >90% Accuracy Target

Saphira uses a multi-pass extraction approach to achieve high accuracy:

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion icon="search" title="Pass 1: Initial Extraction">
  - Document/image structure analysis
  - Primary content extraction
  - Initial requirement identification
  - Component detection from diagrams
</Accordion>

<Accordion icon="crosshairs" title="Pass 2: Refinement">
  - Cross-validation of extracted content
  - Relationship verification
  - Missing field detection
  - Confidence scoring
</Accordion>

<Accordion icon="check-double" title="Pass 3: Validation">
  - Format normalization
  - ID standardization
  - Traceability link verification
  - Quality assurance checks
</Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

### Accuracy by Source Type

| Source Type | Accuracy Target | Key Features |
|-------------|-----------------|--------------|
| PDF Requirements | >90% | Hierarchical extraction, ID preservation |
| Architecture Diagrams | >85% | VLM component detection, relationship mapping |
| Screenshots | >85% | OCR text extraction, table detection |
| Schematics | >80% | Part number extraction, symbol recognition |

### Maximizing Accuracy

To get the best extraction results:

1. **Use High-Resolution Images**: Clear, high-resolution images yield better VLM analysis
2. **Well-Formatted Documents**: Documents with consistent formatting extract more accurately
3. **Clear Labels**: Diagrams with readable labels improve component detection
4. **Review and Edit**: Use the inline editor to refine extracted content


## Integration with Safety Workflows

Extracted requirements and components integrate directly with Saphira's safety analysis:

- **FMEA**: Extracted components become focus elements for failure mode analysis
- **HARA**: Requirements populate hazard sources and control measures
- **TARA**: Interface definitions feed cybersecurity asset identification
- **Gap Analysis**: Extracted specifications enable automated standards compliance checking
- **Safety Case**: Requirements become evidence in GSN safety arguments

## Next Steps After Extraction

After extracting requirements from documents or images, use the **Write & Check Requirements** workflow to:

- Classify requirements at the appropriate level (Stakeholder, System, Subsystem, Component, HW/SW)
- Validate quality with INCOSE linting
- Establish traceability links to safety analyses and other requirements
- Import to your project database with full traceability
